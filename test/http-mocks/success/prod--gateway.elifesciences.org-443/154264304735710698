He holds an Affiliate Professor appointment in the Biochemistry department at the University of Washington. After undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge and post-graduate research at the University of Warwick, he performed postdoctoral research with Bernard Moss at the NIH and with Tony Hunter at the Salk Institute. With Tony, he found that oncogenic retroviruses (Rous sarcoma virus and others) and growth factors (EGF and PDGF) stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of overlapping subsets of cell proteins, which were candidates to regulate cell proliferation and metabolism. He joined Fred Hutch in 1985 to continue the work he started at the Salk, investigating the mechanisms by which protein kinases regulate cell proliferation and transformation. His laboratory played important roles in establishing how Src is regulated, how activated growth factor receptors recruit signaling proteins, and Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling. In 1995, postdoc Brian Howell knocked out the gene for a Src substrate and observed a distinctive brain development phenotype. Efforts by several laboratories rapidly established a signaling pathway that regulates neuron migrations during brain development. Further studies on this pathway revealed the importance of ubiquitination and degradation for terminating signaling, and led in recent years to detailed investigation of the roles of Cullin-RING ligases in regulating signal transduction events in vivo and in cultured cells.","type":"paragraph"}],"research":{"focuses":["signaling pathways","cell migration","phosphorylation","cell transformation"],"expertises":[{"id":"cell-biology","name":"Cell Biology"},{"id":"neuroscience","name":"Neuroscience"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"Jon Cooper receives research grants from the NIH and he serves on the editorial board of Molecular and Cellular Biology."},{"id":"185a8271","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Skinner","givenNames":"Frances K","preferred":"Frances K Skinner","index":"Skinner, Frances K"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"001ceca7ba9dd2e2669ec1a595ab031b","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["computational neuroscience","mathematical modeling","hippocampus","inhibitory cells and microcircuits","nonlinear dynamics","oscillations"],"expertises":[{"id":"neuroscience","name":"Neuroscience"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network"],"address":{"formatted":["Canada"],"components":{"country":"Canada"}}}]},{"id":"18841226","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Murphy","givenNames":"Maureen","preferred":"Maureen Murphy","index":"Murphy, Maureen"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"20000c831ae5db4e1de88eeda3de3173","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["p53","genetics","ferroptosis","cell death","melanoma","heat shock proteins"],"expertises":[{"id":"cancer-biology","name":"Cancer Biology"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["The Wistar Institute"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]},{"id":"78b25132","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Valc\u00e1rcel","givenNames":"Juan","preferred":"Juan Valc\u00e1rcel","index":"Valc\u00e1rcel, Juan"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"e844bbc33929171b47d82ccfd6cc8cd9","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["RNA processing","gene regulation"],"expertises":[{"id":"chromosomes-gene-expression","name":"Chromosomes and Gene Expression"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Centre for Genomic Regulation"],"address":{"formatted":["Spain"],"components":{"country":"Spain"}}}]},{"id":"9a0dfc5e","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Newmark","givenNames":"Phil","preferred":"Phil Newmark","index":"Newmark, Phil"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"c62098986ffb9ee90a6adbc1d765eb81","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["Planarian","regeneration","Schistosoma","germ cells"],"expertises":[{"id":"developmental-biology","name":"Developmental Biology"},{"id":"microbiology-infectious-disease","name":"Microbiology and Infectious Disease"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Morgridge Institute for Research"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]},{"id":"5e55e1c9","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Sharifi","givenNames":"Nima","preferred":"Nima Sharifi","index":"Sharifi, Nima"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"10c53e84b6a6be294986c06c030e3f3c","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["prostate cancer","androgens","steroid metabolism","hormonal therapy","androgen receptor"],"organisms":["human"],"expertises":[{"id":"biochemistry-chemical-biology","name":"Biochemistry and Chemical Biology"},{"id":"cancer-biology","name":"Cancer Biology"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Cleveland Clinic"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]},{"id":"81dd36b6","type":{"id":"leadership","label":"Deputy Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Marder","givenNames":"Eve","preferred":"Eve Marder","index":"Marder, Eve"},"image":{"uri":"https:\/\/iiif.elifesciences.org\/journal-cms\/person%2F2012-03%2Fem03.jpg","alt":"Eve Marder","source":{"mediaType":"image\/jpeg","uri":"https:\/\/iiif.elifesciences.org\/journal-cms\/person%2F2012-03%2Fem03.jpg\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg","filename":"em03.jpg"},"size":{"width":3000,"height":2000},"focalPoint":{"x":50,"y":50}},"profile":[{"text":"Eve Marder is the Victor and Gwendolyn Beinfield Professor of Neuroscience at Brandeis University.

He also serves as Director of the Max Planck\u2013The University of Tokyo Center for Integrative Inflammology. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich.  His work principally concerns the mechanisms of signal transduction and gene expression that underlie immunity and oncogenesis. Many of his research projects have stemmed from his original discovery of two cytokine genes, interferon-beta and interleukin-2. These discoveries have laid the groundwork for the molecular characterization of the various systems of cytokines as well as therapeutic advances achieved by the administration of cytokines. One extension of this research was his discovery of a new family of transcription factors, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which he and others have since identified as playing integral roles in the regulation of the immunity, inflammation and cancer. He has received numerous awards, including the Robert Koch Prize, Pezcoller-AACR International Award for Cancer Research, and was bestowed the Person of Cultural Merit award from the Government of Japan. He was also elected Foreign Associate Member of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, in 2003 and International Member of the National Academy of Medicine in 2016.","type":"paragraph"}],"research":{"focuses":["inflammation","innate immunity","adaptive immunity","immunological disease","anti-tumor immunity","gene regulation in immune cells","signaling in immune cells","gene regulation in host defence"],"expertises":[{"id":"immunology-inflammation","name":"Immunology and Inflammation"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Institute of Industrial Science","The University of Tokyo"],"address":{"formatted":["Japan"],"components":{"country":"Japan"}}}],"competingInterests":"Tada Taniguchi has received funding from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science \u0026amp; Technology in Japan.

She received her AB in Physics from Cornell University and her PhD in Biophysics from Harvard University, where she did thesis work on the structural basis of protein-DNA interactions under the guidance of Steve Harrison and Mark Ptashne. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco with Bob Stroud, she worked on the crystal structures of homeodomain-DNA complexes in the laboratory of Carl Pabo at Johns Hopkins. Her earlier worked focused on the structural basis for combinatorial regulation of gene expression and the molecular mechanisms of the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases. Her current research centers on the mechanisms by which ubiquitin plays a signaling role in transcription and the DNA damage response.
