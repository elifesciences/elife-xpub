He has received Javits and Merit awards from NIH for his research as well as an International Cooperation Award from the Max Planck Society. Dr Westbrook received his medical training and did graduate study in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, followed by residencies in Internal Medicine and Neurology, and basic neuroscience research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Earlier work in his lab was mostly directed at the level of receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and the function of single synapses. The emphasis has now largely shifted to studies of small networks (microcircuits) in the hippocampus and olfactory system.
