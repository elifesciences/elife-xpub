He studied Biology in Wales, Belgium and the USA (Brandeis University) where he got a BA in 1984. He then received his PhD in Biochemistry and Biophysics from Harvard University (1990) where he investigated the cellular basis of axon guidance and target recognition in the developing mouse brain with Wally Gilbert. After a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellowship with Mark Fishman at the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston), where he initiated the studies on zebrafish cardiac development, he set up his lab at the University of California, San Francisco in 1995, where he expanded his research to investigate questions of cell differentiation, tissue morphogenesis, organ homeostasis and function, as well as organ regeneration, in the zebrafish cardiovascular system and endodermal organs. In 2012, he moved to the Max Planck Institute where he continues to utilize both forward and reverse genetic approaches to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of developmental processes during vertebrate organ formation, in both zebrafish and mouse. He is also an Honorary Professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt. In addition to research and mentorship awards at UCSF, he was a Packard Fellow, Basil O\u2019Connor scholar, established Investigator of the American Heart Association, received the American Association of Anatomists Harland Mossman Award in Developmental Biology, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Academia Europaea and European Molecular Biology Organization, as well as an Officier de l\u2019ordre de L\u00e9opold de Belgique.","type":"paragraph"}],"research":{"focuses":["developmental genetics","organogenesis","tissue morphogenesis","organ homeostasis"],"organisms":["zebrafish"],"expertises":[{"id":"developmental-biology","name":"Developmental Biology"}]},"competingInterests":"Didier Stainier has received funding from the Max Planck Society, the European Research Council, the National Institutes of Health, the Packard Foundation, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the American Heart Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Leducq Foundation among others.
