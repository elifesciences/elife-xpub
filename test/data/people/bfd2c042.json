Dr Westbrook is a member of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and past editor-in-chief of the Journal of Neuroscience. He has received Javits and Merit awards from NIH for his research as well as an International Cooperation Award from the Max Planck Society. Dr Westbrook received his medical training and did graduate study in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, followed by residencies in Internal Medicine and Neurology, and basic neuroscience research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Earlier work in his lab was mostly directed at the level of receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and the function of single synapses. The emphasis has now largely shifted to studies of small networks (microcircuits) in the hippocampus and olfactory system. Dr Westbrook maintains interests in clinical neurology, particularly epilepsy, as well as graduate research training \u2013 he currently serves as the director of the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Vollum/OHSU.",
