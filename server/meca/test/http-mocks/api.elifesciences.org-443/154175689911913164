He is also a founding steering committee member of the Ragon Institute of MIT, MGH, and Harvard, and an Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT \u0026amp; Harvard. After obtaining his PhD in chemical engineering and postdoctoral studies, he joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley in December 1988. He rose through the ranks, and ultimately served as the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Distinguished Professor and Chair of Chemical Engineering, Professor of Chemistry, and Professor of Biophysics at Berkeley. He was also Head of Theoretical and Computational Biology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In September 2005, Chakraborty moved to MIT.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"His entire career has been focused on research at the intersection of disciplines. After an early career in engineering of polymers and catalysts, since 2000 Chakraborty\u2019s work has focused on bringing together immunology and the physical and engineering sciences; more specifically, the intersection of statistical mechanics and immunology. His interests span T-cell signaling, T-cell development and repertoire, and a mechanistic understanding of HIV evolution, antibody evolution, and vaccine design. Chakraborty\u2019s work at the intersection of disciplines has been recognized by numerous honors, including the \u003Ci\u003ENIH Director\u2019s Pioneer Award\u003C\/i\u003E, the \u003Ci\u003EEO Lawrence Medal for Life Sciences\u003C\/i\u003E from the US DOE, the \u003Ci\u003EAllan P Colburn\u003C\/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003EProfessional Progress\u003C\/i\u003E awards from the \u003Ci\u003EAIChE\u003C\/i\u003E, a \u003Ci\u003EDreyfus Teacher-Scholar award\u003C\/i\u003E, and a \u003Ci\u003ENational Young investigator award\u003C\/i\u003E.
