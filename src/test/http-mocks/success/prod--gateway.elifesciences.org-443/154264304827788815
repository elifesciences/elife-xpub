She received her AB in Physics from Cornell University and her PhD in Biophysics from Harvard University, where she did thesis work on the structural basis of protein-DNA interactions under the guidance of Steve Harrison and Mark Ptashne. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco with Bob Stroud, she worked on the crystal structures of homeodomain-DNA complexes in the laboratory of Carl Pabo at Johns Hopkins. Her earlier worked focused on the structural basis for combinatorial regulation of gene expression and the molecular mechanisms of the sirtuin family of protein deacetylases. Her current research centers on the mechanisms by which ubiquitin plays a signaling role in transcription and the DNA damage response. Wolberger was a recipient of the David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, a March of Dimes\u2013Basil O\u2019Conor Starter Scholar Award, and an American Cancer Society Junior Faculty Award, and was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator from 1994\u20132014.

In 2006, he was appointed Director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, and Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society. As vice president of the Max Planck Society, Bill Hansson\u0027s main area of responsibility is the biological-medical section, where he is in charge of science and functionality in general. He also has a general responsibility for internationality and construction within the Max Planck Society. As head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology, Bill Hansson focuses on neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of interactions between insects and their host plants. His main research interest is insect olfaction: How do insects detect odors, how is semiochemical information processed in the insect brain, and how does olfaction affect insect behavior? Bill Hansson is Honorary Professor at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena and a fellow of several national and international science academies, such as the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Royal Entomological Society. He has also received several distinguished awards for his research. He has lived in Jena with his wife and two children since 2007.
