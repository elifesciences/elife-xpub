Prior to founding CGHR, Professor Jha served as Senior Scientist for the World Health Organization, where he co-led the work on health and poverty for the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. Earlier, he headed the World Bank team responsible for developing the Second National HIV\/AIDS Control Program in India.

After graduating from the University of Sheffield with a Bachelors degree and the Hans Krebs Prize in Biochemistry, she performed her PhD studies at the MRC Virology Unit in Glasgow, Scotland. During her postdoctoral studies with Dr James Kadonaga at the University of California, San Diego, she identified the key chromatin assembly factors Anti-silencing Function 1 (Asf1) and characterized Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) from Drosophila. In 2000, Dr Tyler started her first faculty position in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA. In the next 10 years, Dr Tyler revealed that chromatin assembly and disassembly not only regulates S phase events, but also gene expression and the DNA damage response. Dr Tyler was a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar and was awarded the Charlotte Friend Woman in Cancer Research Award for 2009 from the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR). Having risen rapidly to the rank of full professor at the University of Colorado, Dr Tyler moved in 2010 to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Her recent work has extended to the broader influence of chromatin assembly on mitosis, aging and cancer. She is now in the Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, where she co-directs the Center for Cancer Epigenetics and holds the Edward Rotan Distinguished Professorship in Cancer Research. Her most proud achievement is being mother to 11 year-old triplets. In November 2015, she became a Professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.","type":"paragraph"}],"research":{"focuses":["epigenetic regulation","chromatin","gene expression","mitosis","aging","cancer"],"organisms":["\u003Ci\u003ES. cerevisiae\u003C\/i\u003E"],"expertises":[{"id":"chromosomes-gene-expression","name":"Chromosomes and Gene Expression"},{"id":"genetics-genomics","name":"Genetics and Genomics"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Weill Cornell Medicine"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}],"competingInterests":"Previous funding has come from March of Dimes, Susan Komen, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Foundation, NIH, and CPRIT.
