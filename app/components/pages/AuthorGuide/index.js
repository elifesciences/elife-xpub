      eLife publishes promising research across the life sciences and
      biomedicine. Before you submit your work, please note that eLife is a very
      selective journal that aims to publish work of the highest scientific
      standards and importance. Leading academic researchers evaluate new
      submissions and approximately two-thirds are returned to the authors
      without further peer review. Approximately half of the articles that are
      selected for peer review go on to be published.
