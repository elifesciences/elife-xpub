    <H2>Availability of Data, Software, and Research Materials</H2>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Data, methods used in the analysis, and materials used to conduct the
      research must be clearly and precisely documented, and be maximally
      available to any researcher for purposes of reproducing the results or
      replicating the procedure.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Regardless of whether authors use original data or are reusing data
      available from public repositories, they must provide program code,
      scripts for statistical packages, and other documentation sufficient to
      allow an informed researcher to precisely reproduce all published results.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      In rare cases, despite authors’ best efforts, certain data or materials
      cannot be shared for legal or ethical reasons. In such cases, authors must
      inform the editors at the time of submission. This will be taken into
      account during the review process. Authors are encouraged to anticipate
      data and material sharing at the beginning of their projects to provide
      for these circumstances. Editors may grant exceptions to data and material
      access requirements provided that authors:
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <List.Unordered>
      <li>
        explain the restrictions on the dataset or materials and how they
        preclude public access;
      </li>
      <li>
        provide a public description of the steps others should follow to
        request access to the data or materials;
      </li>
      <li>
        provide software and other documentation that will precisely reproduce
        all published results;

    <H3>Data Availability</H3>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      To maintain high standards of research reproducibility, and to promote the
      reuse of new findings, eLife requires all datasets associated with an
      article to be made freely and widely available (unless there are strong
      reasons to restrict access, for example in the case of human subjects
      data), in the most useful formats, and according to the relevant reporting
      standards.

      (Cromey 2010, Sci Eng Ethics, 16-639-667) for valuable guidance on
      acceptable practice and examples of inappropriate manipulation. Please
      take note of the following guidance in particular:
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <List.Unordered>
      <li>
        Minimal processing of images (for example, changing brightness and
        contrast) is appropriate only where it is applied equally across the
        whole image and is equally applied to controls.
      </li>
      <li>Contrast should not be adjusted to obscure data.</li>
      <li>
        Processing an image to emphasise one region at the expense of others, or
        to emphasise experimental data relative to the control, is not
        permitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combining images that should otherwise be presented separately may
        misrepresent the original data. If different images do need to be
        combined, then this should be clearly indicated in the image (for
        example, including dividing lines in gels) and described in the Figure
        legend.
      </li>
    </List.Unordered>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Please note that authors should provide information within their
      submission about the tools and techniques used when acquiring and
      preparing images. For example, submissions including microscopy images or
      autoradiograms should include information about the exposure times, the
      acquisition parameters, and whether the image received any
      post-acquisition treatment (for example stating if the format or scales
      were modified).
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Images may be subject to screening prior to acceptance and we may need to
      request the original, unprocessed figure files/raw data for further
      review.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <H2>Licensing</H2>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Because articles published by eLife are licensed under a{' '}

      , others are free to copy, distribute, and reuse them (in part or in
      full), without needing to seek permission, as long as the author and
      original source are properly cited.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <H2>Media Policy</H2>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      eLife’s media policy is designed to encourage high-quality, informed and
      widespread discussion of new research – before and after publication.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <H3>Presenting and discussing work prior to publication</H3>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Prior to publication, authors are encouraged to present their findings to
      their peers, including at meetings and conferences; to deposit a copy of
      their manuscript with a preprint server (or other open repository or
      website); and to blog about their findings. None of these activities will
      affect consideration of a manuscript for publication in eLife. Where there
      is media interest in a paper that has been accepted by eLife, and likely
      media coverage in advance of publication, we encourage the authors to take
      advantage of the eLife option to publish their manuscript within a few
      days of acceptance (our “publish on accept” service), so that readers of
      any (potential) early coverage will be able to access the full paper as
      soon as possible.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Authors are welcome to speak to the media about their work at any time
      prior to publication and may share advance copies of their manuscript with
      journalists as they prefer. They may also wish to ask their institutional
      press officers to help with advance promotion, once the manuscript is
      accepted. However, eLife encourages press officers to pitch studies widely
      at the time of publication only, rather than in advance, so that as many
      journalists as possible receive the story, and access to the full,
      peer-reviewed paper, at the same time.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <H3>Our policy not to embargo eLife papers</H3>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Because authors are completely free to release their content ahead of
      publication and to talk with the media at any stage, we do not release
      content under embargo, except under exceptional circumstances. This means
      that journalists can write and publish articles about a study in advance
      of publication without breaking an embargo. However, we strongly recommend
      that their stories are published at the time of or after publication, so
      that readers have access to the full, peer-reviewed paper.
    </Paragraph.Reading>

    <H3>Making content widely accessible</H3>

    <Paragraph.Reading>
      Many eLife papers are published with a plain-language summary (called an
      eLife digest) to explain the background and central findings of the work
      to a broad readership. We also publish the most substantive parts of the
      decision letter that is sent to authors after peer review (and which is
      based on the referees&apos; reports on the paper), along with the
      authors&apos; response to this letter, to provide greater context for the
      work. Where eLife considers papers to be of potential interest to a broad
      audience, these will also be promoted widely to the media and to
      interested readers either on the day of publication or post publication.

    <H2>Preregistration</H2>
