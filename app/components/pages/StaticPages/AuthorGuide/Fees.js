    <H1>Publication Fees FAQs</H1>

    <Paragraph>
      A fee of $2,500* is collected for published papers; however, authors with
      insufficient funding to pay the fee are eligible for a fee waiver.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      The publication fee (also referred to as an &quot;open-access&quot; or
      &quot;article-processing&quot; fee) is a charge collected by many
      open-access publishers to help recover the costs of publication while
      providing free and open access for the reader to use and re-use results.
      eLife provides open access to all content.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      * If the fee is invoiced to an individual, rather than a business, then
      VAT of 20% is added to the fee.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>1. How did eLife decide on a fee of $2,500?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      As a non-profit organisation, we feel the fee should be derived from our
      real costs. At $2,500, the publication fee covers the marginal costs that
      we incur for every new article we publish. It does not cover our fixed
      publishing costs or the costs of our technology and innovation efforts. By
      recovering our marginal costs, we can help to ensure the long-term growth
      of eLife. We also considered how the fee compares to those at other
      journals and believe we offer good value.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      A detailed overview of how we arrived at the fee is available at:{' '}

      .
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>2. I can’t afford a $2,500 fee. What can I do?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      It is very important that our introduction of a publication fee does not
      inhibit the submission of excellent work from labs with insufficient
      access to funds. We will make{' '}
      <NativeLink href="#waiver">a waiver</NativeLink> available for labs under
      financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or
      state of funding.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>3. Will my ability to pay influence consideration of my paper?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      No. Editors have no knowledge of waiver requests or financial
      arrangements. Ability to pay will have no bearing on editorial decisions.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>4. What article types are affected?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      The publication fee will apply to Research Articles, Short Reports, and
      Tools and Resources that have been submitted on or after January 1, 2017.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>5. What do I get in return, as an author?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      There is tremendous variation in the fees charged for open-access
      publishing, and we therefore encourage all authors, including eLife
      authors, to ask themselves this question when they are considering where
      to publish their work. eLife offers:
    </Paragraph>

    <List.Unordered>
      <li>
        Clear, constructive input from experts in your field. eLife post-review
        decisions are the product of a consultation among reviewers – overseen
        by the working scientists who serve as eLife editors – who achieve a
        consensus on major points before sending consolidated feedback to
        authors. As a result of this constructive and efficient process most
        published articles go through only one round of review and revision.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open access. All research papers published at eLife, along with
        associated datasets and media files, are made freely and immediately
        available online for all to read and use, provided the original author
        is given credit. Your work will also be delivered to PubMed Central
        immediately on publication. Publication in eLife thus complies with all
        international funder policies on public and open access.
      </li>
      <li>
        The freedom to present your work in full. eLife imposes no limit to the
        length of your Research Article or the number of figures, tables,
        datasets or videos that you wish to present in the main body of the
        article. Authors also have the option to publish your article within 1-2
        days of acceptance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wide exposure. Your work will be published alongside other excellent
        science evaluated and selected by the editors of eLife. eLife is indexed
        by all the major databases including Medline and the Web of Science, and
        eLife papers routinely appear in the mainstream media. We also often
        work with early-stage investigators to help gain attention for their
        work through interviews, podcasts, and public appearances.
      </li>
    </List.Unordered>

    <H3>
      6. eLife was recently granted a second round of funding, so why do you
      need to start charging fees?
    </H3>

    <Paragraph>
      Publication fees are a part of our long-term growth strategy, which also
      continues to involve a close relationship with research funders who have
      made it possible for us not to charge before now. The intent of the fee is
      to cover our marginal publication costs, or the cost of every new research
      article we publish, so that we can support the continued expansion of the
      journal.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      We also feel that eLife has a role to play in the economics of the science
      publishing marketplace. We would like to try and have a positive influence
      on how publication charges fit into the future of funding open-access
      publishing by being open about our costs, value, and fees.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>7. I’m funded by the same funders as eLife. Will I have to pay?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      Yes. The fee will apply to all research papers including those with
      investigators associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max
      Planck Society, the Wellcome Trust and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg
      Foundation. The generous support of these organisations will help us cover
      the balance of our publishing costs (our fixed costs) and enable us to
      invest in technology and innovation.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>8. Will the publication fee be increased in future?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      We have set the fee in a way that makes it possible to maintain it at the
      same level, and cover our marginal costs, for several years to come,
      despite fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, for example. We will
      continue to be open and transparent about our costs and publishing volumes
      and, in several years time, be prepared to revisit the relationship of the
      fee to our costs, as well as other sources of revenue.{' '}
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>9. How does the fee relate to eLife’s long-term financial plan?</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      The publication fee is an important part of our long-term plan, helping to
      ensure we can continue to grow the eLife journal at its current rate. As a
      result, we can dedicate the support of our funders to the ongoing costs of
      publishing and the value we add (such as eLife Digests and Insights), and
      to experimenting and innovating in research communication. We’ll be
      creative in exploring other revenue streams in future, which may or may
      not include advertising, submission fees, additional grants, or fees for
      valuable services.

    <H2 id="waiver">eLife publication fee waiver policy (December 2016)</H2>

    <Paragraph>
      eLife recognises that there are various circumstances in which the authors
      of an eLife article might not have access to sufficient funds to cover the
      publication fee. To ensure that eLife’s publication fee is not a barrier
      to publication we therefore offer a simple way for authors to apply for a
      fee waiver.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Authors are expected to have explored all reasonable sources for paying
      the publication fee and may apply for a fee waiver once their submission
      has been invited for full peer review. Waiver requests are considered on a
      case-by-case basis and should be accompanied by a brief justification from
      the author.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      The information that authors provide to support their waiver application
      will offer valuable insight into the availability of funds for publication
      fees. There are no strict criteria for a fee waiver because of the variety
      of circumstances that might lead to insufficient funds being available,
      such as: lack of support from the funder or institution, termination of a
      grant, career stage, geographic location, or a discipline with less
      funding.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      All waiver requests will be treated confidentially, but we will highlight
      trends in the information as it accumulates to help inform funder and
      institutional policy with respect to the support of open-access
      publishing.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      <strong>
        eLife academic editors and reviewers have no access to information about
        waiver requests, which can therefore never influence editorial
        decisions.
      </strong>
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>Refund Policy</H3>

    <Paragraph>
      We place great importance on giving authors a prompt, fair and responsive
      service. However, if a manuscript is accepted for publication and our
      service falls far short of an acceptable standard, we may waive the
      publication fee. In addition, we may decide to refund a publication fee
      that has already been paid in exceptional circumstances, for example where
      an author withdraws a manuscript after acceptance.
