My scientific journey thus far has seen me do research on understanding immune responses to oral vaccination and infectious insult, pre-clinical development of malaria transmission-blocking vaccines and currently understanding the epidemiology of malaria transmission from man to mosquitoes. All of this work, in some form has ended up in a write, show and tell. The need as an early career scientist to be engaged in the design and implementation of one\u2019s scientific journey is of utmost and paramount importance. To be able to share not just the dynamic output of one\u2019s laboratory adventures but also to share the other aspects of that journey, experience with funding, grant writing and management, work-life balance amongst others. This path so far has seen me grow not only scientifically but also personally and allow myself to be challenged beyond my borders.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Getting involved to be a voice and be heard is what being part of the eLife early careers advisory group is all about.

He was born in Jonstorp, in the south of Sweden, and studied biology at the University of Lund. After his PhD in ecology and a postdoctoral stay in the United States, he became Professor for Chemical Ecology, first in Lund and, beginning in 2001, at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Alnarp. In 2006, he was appointed Director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, and Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society. As vice president of the Max Planck Society, Bill Hansson\u0027s main area of responsibility is the biological-medical section, where he is in charge of science and functionality in general. He also has a general responsibility for internationality and construction within the Max Planck Society. As head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology, Bill Hansson focuses on neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of interactions between insects and their host plants. His main research interest is insect olfaction: How do insects detect odors, how is semiochemical information processed in the insect brain, and how does olfaction affect insect behavior? Bill Hansson is Honorary Professor at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena and a fellow of several national and international science academies, such as the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Royal Entomological Society. He has also received several distinguished awards for his research. He has lived in Jena with his wife and two children since 2007. Nevertheless, he maintains close ties to his home country, where he and his family usually spend the summer in their own forest.","type":"paragraph"}]},{"id":"8b64e68b","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Verstynen","givenNames":"Timothy","preferred":"Timothy Verstynen","index":"Verstynen, Timothy"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"7c1dce490b3d088bb21d44086bae8791","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["cognition","decision-making"],"organisms":["human"],"expertises":[{"id":"computational-systems-biology","name":"Computational and Systems Biology"},{"id":"neuroscience","name":"Neuroscience"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]},{"id":"cb5882b4","type":{"id":"reviewing-editor","label":"Reviewing Editor"},"name":{"surname":"Gallant","givenNames":"Jack L","preferred":"Jack L Gallant","index":"Gallant, Jack L"},"emailAddresses":[{"value":"365365dfc16514f248ea4e1995f947f4","access":"restricted"}],"research":{"focuses":["cognitive neuroscience","computational neuroscience","systems neuroscience"],"expertises":[{"id":"neuroscience","name":"Neuroscience"}]},"affiliations":[{"name":["University of California","Berkeley"],"address":{"formatted":["United States"],"components":{"country":"United States"}}}]},{"id":"cad27fb3","type":{"id":"early-career","label":"Early Careers Advisory Group"},"name":{"surname":"Weissgerber","givenNames":"Tracey","preferred":"Tracey Weissgerber","index":"Weissgerber, Tracey"},"image":{"uri":"https:\/\/iiif.elifesciences.org\/journal-cms\/person%2F2018-08%2Fweissgerber_cropped_1.jpg","alt":"","source":{"mediaType":"image\/jpeg","uri":"https:\/\/iiif.elifesciences.org\/journal-cms\/person%2F2018-08%2Fweissgerber_cropped_1.jpg\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg","filename":"weissgerber_cropped_1.jpg"},"size":{"width":2889,"height":4333},"focalPoint":{"x":49,"y":44}},"profile":[{"text":"Tracey\u2019s meta-research aims to improve the quality of data visualization, statistical analysis and statistical reporting in the basic biomedical sciences.
