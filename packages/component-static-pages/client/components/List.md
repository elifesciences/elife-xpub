    Title: The title should ideally be fewer than 120 characters, with a clear
    indication of the biological system under investigation (if appropriate),
    and should avoid abbreviations and unfamiliar acronyms if possible. Please
    note that two-part titles – e.g. “What goes up must come down: Oscillations
    in transcriptional networks” – are not permitted for research papers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Author names and affiliations: A complete list of authors and affiliations
    should be provided in the paper itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abstract: The abstract should be fewer than 150 words and should not contain
    subheadings. It should provide a clear, measured, and concise summary of the
    work. If the biological system (species names or broader taxonomic groups if
    appropriate) is not mentioned in the title, it must be included in the
    abstract.
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduction, Results, Discussion, Materials and Methods: We encourage a
    clear and concise style of writing. Various writing guides are available,
    including Preparing a Manuscript for Submission to a Biomedical Journal
    (ICMJE) and The Elements of Style (New York: bartleby.com, 1999).
